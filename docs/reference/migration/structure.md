# Reference Project Structure

Before translating an existing project into Rust, capture the essentials of the
source implementation so you can mirror it accurately. Drop the reference
materials under `tmp/` (for example, `tmp/oxbed.md`) and update the sections
below with their contents.

## Summary

- **Reference path**: `tmp/<reference-file>`
- **Project description**: what the reference app does, main features, and the
  domain it serves.

## Language and Ecosystem

- **Primary language / runtime**: Identify the existing stack (e.g.,
  TypeScript/node, Python, Go) and any notable language features you rely on
  (async coroutines, macros, etc.).
- **Version constraints**: record the main interpreter/compiler version(s) in
  use.

## Dependencies

List the libraries, packages, or frameworks the source project depends on. For
each dependency include:

| Name | Purpose | Version/constraint | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------ | ----- |
|      |         |                    |       |

Add multiple entries for runtime, build, test, or tooling dependencies. Explain
any custom extensions or native bindings.

## Build Process

- **Commands**: record how the source project is built (`npm run build`,
  `pip wheel`, `make`, etc.).
- **Artifacts produced**: describe binaries, packages, or distributables
  generated by the build.
- **Special steps**: note any code generation, environment scaffolding, or
  compiler flags.

## Run and Runtime Behavior

- **Launch commands**: how to run the app locally (CLI flags, env var sets,
  config files).
- **Runtime assumptions**: expected ports, background services, configuration
  injection, or scheduling behavior.
- **Observability**: logging frameworks, metrics, or tracing used in the
  reference project.

## Testing and Validation

- **Test suites**: list unit, integration, or system tests the reference project
  depends on, including commands to execute them.
- **Test data**: mention fixtures, sample data, or mocking layers.
- **Validation steps**: describe how you know the reference features are working
  (assertions, schema checks, e2e flows).

Keep this document updated every time a new reference project is added; it is
the ground truth that the migration work will follow.

## Attribution

- Every migration must include a short “thanks to” or “reference” field—either
  in the new README, docs, or release notes—acknowledging the original project
  that inspired the port. Record the original repository/project name and a
  sentence about what you borrowed so that future readers understand the
  lineage.
